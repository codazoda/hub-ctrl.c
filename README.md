hub-ctrl.c
==========

Control USB power on a port by port basis on some USB hubs.

Originally created by NIIBE Yutaka and published to Github by Joel Dare on January

This only works on USB hubs that have the hardware necessary to allow
software controlled power switching. Most hubs DO NOT include the hardware.

Prerequisites
=============

Before compiling it, you'll need to install libusb-dev (under Ubuntu). I
installed that with the following command.

    sudo apt-get install libusb-dev

You'll also need the GCC tool chain.

Compiling
=========

To compile the hub-ctrl.c program run the following compile command.

    gcc -o hub-ctrl hub-ctrl.c -lusb

That results in an executable binary called hub-ctrl.

Controlling Power
=================

You can control the power on a port using the following command.

    sudo ./hub-ctrl -h 3 -P 1 -p 0

That says to control hub 3 (-h 3) port 1 (-P 1) and to turn the power
off (-p 0). You can also use ”-p 1” to turn the power back on.

You can also specify the USB device based on the BUS and DEV numbers. Use the
following command the list the currently connected devices. It's useful to run
this with the device disconnected and then again with the device connected so
that you can tell which device is the one you are trying to target (the Targus
in my case).

Now that we know the BUS and DEV numbers, we can control the power using those
numbers as well. Here's the command for that.

    sudo ./hub-ctrl -b 001 -d 005 -P 1 -p 0

This time we are controlling the device on BUS 001 (-b 001) device 005 (-d 005)
port 1 (-P 1) and turning the power off (-p 0).

Hubs Known to Work

The following is a list of Hubs that are known to have the hardware necessary
to allow power switching.
